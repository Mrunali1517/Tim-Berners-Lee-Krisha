            <h3>Founder of WWW(World Wide Web)</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory,
                in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML
                were refined as Web technology spread.

                He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up that uses, promotes and helps develop the
                open source Solid platform. Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning
                many assumptions about how the web has to work. Solid technically is a new level of standard at the web
                layer, which adds features never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on, universal
                access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place. Socially
                Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users
                are in control, and empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.

                Sir Tim is the Founder, Emeritus Director, and an Honorary Member of the Board of Directors of the World
                Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization that he founded in 1994 which develops
                interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full
                potential. He is a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation that was launched in 2009 to coordinate
                efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.

                He is the Emeritus 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint
                appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for
                Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence ( CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
                where he founded the Decentralized Information Group (DIG).

                Research at DIG and its collaborators was the origin of what became the Solid Platform.

                He is also a Professor in the Computer Science Department, and an Honorary Student at Christ Church, at
                the University of Oxford, UK. He is President of and co-founder the Open Data Institute in London.</p>
